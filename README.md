## Smart Contract Management - ETH + AVAX
A basic contract containing 2-3 functions that display their output values in the application's front end.
## Description
This basic contract will include 2-3 functions that demonstrate their outputs on the application's front end. These functions might include depositing funds, viewing the account balance, and withdrawing money. The front end will display the current balance, allow users to make deposits, and update the balance accordingly.
## Features
* Authenticate users and sign transactions using the MetaMask wallet.
* Facilitate transactions like deposits and withdrawals directly from the MetaMask wallet.
* Offer a personalized experience by fetching user account details from MetaMask.
* Support upgradability to modify the contract logic without affecting existing functionality.
## How I excute the program
1. Open VS Code and create a new file for contract.
2. Use the template provided by Meta Crafters (Chris).
3. Open the terminal and follow the instructions from readme.md.
4. After completing the terminal setup and coding, navigate to localhost:3000.
5. Connect your wallet to MetaMask, creating an account and network first.
6. Once connected, you can deposit and withdraw funds.
## Note
Ensure that the balance updates when depositing and withdrawing. If you see the balance change, it means the transaction was successful.
